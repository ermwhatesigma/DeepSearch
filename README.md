# DeepSearch
This is a python code that tries to find information about people. It tries to search their name on platafroms like social media and google. It also has an email and phone number scraper. Remember the scrapers might not always work. **note** The AI is still a work in progress
I also added DDoS attacker and a port scanner **note** The DDoS might not work. It is Still a Work in progres

**Wat is deepsearch**

DeepSearch is a simple script i made. It's used to search people's first and last names online with the links that are already set in the code. At the end of the name searcher it gives an AI preview from brave. After you type someting it clears the page. It doesn't automaticly save the asked questions.
DeepSearch also has an build in phone number and email scraper. It tries to find all the numbers that can potationaly be a phone number. It also displays all the words with a @ in it so it is easier to find an email. But because of that it might also provide you with random things.
DeepSearch also has an AI in it. The AI is still a work in progress so it won't answer everything you want. But it will work if you wanna have a normal conversation with it the AI moddel is bigscience/bloom-560m It is a small moddel so it might not work as intended.

*I'll try and add a few new functions soon*


**How to use it?**
